// What is three.js

// Definition

// A high-level JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in web browsers

// Purpose

// Simplifies 3D graphics creation and animation (models, particle systems, lights, cameras) without low-level WebGL code knowledge

// Graphic Processing

// What is graphic processing?

// - The process of rendering 3D graphics on a computer screen in real-time Requires millions of calculations per second

// Why is it complex?

// - The computer needs to know information like the position, color, and location of every vertex of an object

// - There is a piece of instruction needed for each pixel on the screen

// What is a GPU?

// - Stand for Graphic Processing Unit

// - A special type of hardware that can run simple calculations in parallel

// - Designed to handle the demands of rendering 3D graphics

// WebGL

// - WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics in a web browser using the GPU

// - WebGL provides a language to talk to the GPU and instruct it on what to render

// three.js and WebGL

// Three.js is built on top of WebGL and implements it under the hood

// Three.js abstracts the complicated WebGL language into an easy-to-use JavaScript API allowing for creative focus on projects
