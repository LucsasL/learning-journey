// Three.js Fundamentals

// Structure of a Three.js Application

// The main parts of a 3D application: The Scene, the Camera and the Renderer

// - Scene: Is everything that can be seen in a 3D Graphical App / Interface

//  -> It contains all the objects, lights, textures, meshs, backgrounds, materials and shape; It's conceptually everything that exist in a 3D graphical environment / interface

// - Camera: What the determines what the viewwe / user see

// - Renderer: Takes information from the scene and the camera to the viewer / user

//  -> Method that generates a 3D Environment: Renderer.render(scene, camera)
