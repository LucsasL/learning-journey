// Link

// Link is a component provided by Next.js that allows you to create links to navigate between pages in your application.

// It's primarily used for declarative, client-side navigation. When you click on a link created with <Link />, it prevents the default browser full-page refresh and fetches the new page content on the client side, resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.

// It's tipically used in your component's JSX code to create clickable links that lead to other pages within your Next.js application.
