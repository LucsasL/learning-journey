// useRouter()

// useRouter is a hook provided by Next.js that allows you to access the router object and its properties within your component.

// It provides programmatic control over the router and allows you to navigate to different pages or perform other routing-related actions in response to user interactions or events within you component.

// It's useful when you need to handle navigation or access route-specific information directly in your component logic.
