// The goal of this exercise is to practice fetching data on the client side in a Next.js application using client-side rendering techniques.

// 1. Create a new route in the "app" directory, named "clientdatafetch"

// 2. In the "clientdatafetch" route, use Next.js's useEffect and fetch (or any preferred data fetching method) to retrieve data from a publicly available API, such as the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) or (https://dummyjson.com/products).

// 3. Display the fetched data on the "clientdatafetch" page. For example, you can display a list of posts, users, or any other relevant data from the API.

// 4. Ensure that the data fetching and rendering occur on the client side by making the API request in the browser, not during server-side rendering.

// 5. Test the application.
