// Every JavaScript object has a anonymous property called prototype

// Remember functions & arrays are also an object

// That prototype will be the parent of that object, prototype property is an object by itself, which have same special properties & method

// Every object is associated with another object. The object (a) is associated with [[Prototype]] Object

// -> Which means a object will inherit all properties of Object.prototype || [[Prototype]]
