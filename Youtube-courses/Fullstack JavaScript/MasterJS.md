# From Zero to Full Stack: Master JavaScript and Create Dynamic Web Apps

Ever since I've started developing my first websites I was curious to understand and dissect the web technologies, and as the time has passed I was getting more lost and lost. And even today, I haven't touched any *framework* or other extension of ***JavaScript*** other than the `*ECMAScript*` (the default version). And as I was thinking in all those last months in my *learning journey*, I just realized that I wasn't focusing in the area I'm more used to, I was keeping studying the same basic things in programming and not getting anywhere, from this conclusion, I decided to take I big course focused on web that show more of the frameworks I need to know to work properly, and I found this course series, the [*JavaScript Fullstack Master*](https://youtu.be/H3XIJYEPdus?si=ciwv6rjdZXc9FGUe) from [***HuXn WebDev.***](https://github.com/HuXn-WebDev)
