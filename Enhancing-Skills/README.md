# Enhancing Skills

`This repository is an extension of the learning-journey repository (https://github.com/lucsasl/learning-journey)`

As the name of the repository suggests, this is a repository where I study deeper topics of the technologies I'm interested in, based on their own documentation.

As time passes, technologies and languages keep evolving and adding new features, paradigms, and ways to solve problems. Because of this, tech courses become more and more outdated and limited, which can make you lose your edge as a programmer. This repo was created as a way to keep my skills up to date as they improve with time.

**Work in Progress**
