// GSAP is a JS Library used to create animations for HTML elements by coding, It is used for complex animations involving SVG manipulation, scroll triggers and even changing basic elements properties

// To install the GSAP library dowload a ZIP with the main files (you can also import it through the API link) and load it into your js file

// Loading with API link:
// import gsap from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.12.5/dist/gsap.min.js";

// Loading with module installed:
import gsap from "gsap";

// By doing that, you're able to use all the different function the gsap module has

// It's important that you register all the plugins from the module by using gsap.registerPlugin(<*pluginName>) function before using them, since  build tools can be over-aggressive and drop essential plugins for the application

gsap.registerPlugin();
